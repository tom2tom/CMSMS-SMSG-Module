Each working gateway needs a class file, named like 'class.somename_sms_gateway.php',
located in module directory '.../lib/gateways', and containing at least a 
corresponding class named like 'somename_sms_gateway'.

For efficiency purposes, it would be best to leave as few classes as possible in
the gateways directory. Park the unused ones somewhere else.

NEW GATEWAYS

The file 'class.skeleton_sms_gateway.php' constitutes a template of sorts.

Gateway class developers should become familiar with the API of the parent-class
(smsg_sender_base), and may get some inspiration from existing gateways, of course.

Existing 'infrastructure' from gateway providers can be used, provided there's a
suitable interface to it.

Add any translateable strings to Lang file(s), including one string to be used as
a one-line reference in module help.
