Google Voice PHP API
====================

An API to interact with Google Voice using PHP.

Currently the API can place calls, send and receive SMS messages, and
download transcriptions of voicemail.

Feel free to implement new functionality and send me your changes so
I can incorporate them into this library!

Note: Receiving SMSs and voicemails is mostly unnecessary via this API
since Google now allows SMSs to be forwarded to an email address. It is 
a better idea to parse those incoming emails with a script.
